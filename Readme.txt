Calgary Air Quality Analysis ETL Project:

This project involves the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of air quality data for the City of Calgary. The project utilized Apache Spark for data processing and culminated in the creation of data visualizations to provide actionable insights.

Project Overview:

The objective of this project was to develop an ETL pipeline that processes large sets of raw air quality data, transforms it into a usable format, and loads it for further analysis. The final step involved visualizing trends in air quality data to support decision-making related to environmental monitoring.

Key Features:

ETL Pipeline: Data extraction from multiple sources, transformation using Spark for cleaning and aggregation, and loading into a structured format for analysis.
Data Transformation: Using Sparkâ€™s powerful processing capabilities to filter, aggregate, and clean raw air quality data.
Data Visualization: Generated interactive visualizations to track air quality trends over time, providing insights into pollution levels and other environmental factors.
Team Leadership: Led a team of four, coordinating project tasks and completing the majority of the technical work.
Technologies Used
Apache Spark for data transformation
Python for scripting and data manipulation
Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization
Matplotlib/Seaborn for creating visualizations
Project Workflow
Data Extraction: Collected raw air quality data from provided sources.
Data Transformation: Cleaned and aggregated the data using Spark.
Data Loading: Prepared the transformed data for analysis.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations to identify trends in air quality.

Results:

The final project provides insights into air quality patterns, which can be used by local authorities and environmental groups for monitoring pollution and making informed decisions.
